# 译者的话

在翻译的过程中，作者和我有不少邮件往来。其中一封说到：

> The Third Edition will be my final edition becuse I am 81 years old and can not write a fourth edition any more; instead, I will keep writing an Addendum to the third edition, because I am still researching piano, and discovering new useful information. Please try to use the same terminology as used in the second edition translation as much as possible because, in the future, the Chinese terminology you use will become part of Chinese piano culture because many concepts are new so that those terminologies are new. When your translations are mostly finished, I encourage you to sell a printed version of your translation, as I am doing with my book.

1998年退休后，他继续能写书，直到现在81岁。耄耋之年仍然研究不辍的精神，让我这种年轻人很震撼，这就是“苟日新，又日新，日日新”的一种实际诠释。
