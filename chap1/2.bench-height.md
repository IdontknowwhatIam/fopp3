# 2.凳高、距离和姿势

The **bench height** should be set so that the elbows are slightly below the level of the keys when the upper arms are hanging straight down with the hands on the keyboard in playing position. Sit on the front half of the bench, not in the center, and at a **distance from the piano** such that the body does not interfere with the elbows when they move towards each other in front of the chest. For beginners, benches with fixed height will not be problematic because they can adapt to a range of heights.  
**凳子的高度**应该设置在上臂笔直向下悬垂的时候，且键盘上的手处于演奏位置，并且肘部略低于键盘的高度。坐在长凳的前半部分，而不是在中央，并且**与钢琴保持一定距离**，这样当肘部在胸部前部彼此相对移动时，身体不会干扰肘部。对于初学者来说，固定高度的长凳不会有问题，因为初学者可以适应一定范围的凳子高度。 

Low bench height has the advantage that it makes it easier to lift the fingers, especially the 4th, and it may allow a straighter wrist, thus reducing the chances of contracting carpal tunnel syndrome. The shoulders will be closer to the keys, providing a wider reach and the head will be closer to the keys, providing a more intimate feel of the keys. It also makes it easier to sit with a straight spine and to sit farther away from the piano, which provides more elbow space. Sitting lower is more compatible with many techniques such as \(21\) Forearm Rotation, using the Power Thumb \[\(31\) Thumb, Most Versatile Finger, Power Thumb\] or the flat finger positions \[\(4\) Curled and Flat Finger Positions, Curl Paralysis\], etc. It also allows the use of forearm rotation to rotate the wrist rapidly.  
低板凳高度的优点是可以更容易地抬起手指，尤其是第四只手指，并且可以使手腕伸直，从而减少患上腕管综合症的机会。肩膀将更靠近琴键，从而提供更大的触及范围，而头部将更靠近琴键，从而为琴键提供更亲密的感觉。它也使坐直的脊椎和远离钢琴的坐姿更加容易，从而提供了更大的肘部空间。坐下更适合许多技术，例如使用Power Thumb \[（31）Thumb，最通用的手指，Power Thumb\]或扁平手指位置\[（4）卷曲和扁平手指位置，卷曲麻痹）（21）前臂旋转\]等。它还允许使用前臂旋转来快速旋转手腕。

**Posture** is important: a high position can cause the players to hunch their backs, so that a conscious effort must be made to sit straight up. Massage therapists know that a crooked
