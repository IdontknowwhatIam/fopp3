# 3.开始弹奏一份乐谱

Learn only music that you can perform. The days of "years of exercises and lesson pieces for technical development" are over. Start assembling a repertoire immediately; the list of great music containing technical lessons is effectively infinite, so you don't need anything else! It is never too early to practice performances; it is never too early to make music. One of the most harmful comments I have heard is that youngsters are too young for Chopin. Then there is kiddie music for the youngest: kiddie music exists only in the minds of adults. Children of any age can appreciate good music and perform them; there isn't a single reason why children should be held back.  
只学习可以演奏的音乐。 “多年的练习和技术培养课程”的日子已经过去。 立即开始“组装”你的常备节目； 包含技术课程的出色音乐列表实际上是无限的，因此您不需要其他东西！ 练习表演永远不会太早。 制作音乐永远不会太早。 我听到的最有害的评论之一是“小孩子弹肖邦还太早”，然后是“最小的孩子就该弹幼儿音乐”——小孩音乐只存在于成年人的脑海中。 任何年龄的孩子都可以欣赏和表演优美的音乐，没有一个理由让孩子退缩。

Of course, beginners need Beginner books,, \(Humphries, Beyer, Thompson, Faber & Faber, etc.\) to learn the necessary conventions and basic music theory. There is no need to go through every page, just pick up those elements that are new to you. With the practice methods of this book, the student can start with performable music that may present challenges, but such challenges are just what is needed to learn how to use these methods. Exercise/lesson books such Hanon, Czerny, Cramer-Bulow, Dohnanyi Exercises, Cortot, etc., are obsolete. There are pianists who were raised on such exercises that still teach them and they are certainly not worthless, but there are better methods. There is plenty of easy starter music that are performable, such as Magdalena's [Easy Bach](https://imslp.org/wiki/First_Lessons_in_Bach_%28Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian%29). Most importantly, choose the music that you like. We shall choose Beethoven's **Für Elise** \([Sheet Music](http://www.pianopractice.org/sheetmusic2.pdf),\) to illustrate the practice methods because it can be learned very quickly using these methods and contains all the elements needed to illustrate them.  
当然，初学者需要初学者书籍（Humphries，Beyer，Thompson，Faber&Faber等），以学习必要的传统手法和基本的音乐理论。无需浏览每个页面，只需选择对您来说是新的那些元素即可。通过本书的练习方法，学生可以从可能会带来挑战的可演奏音乐开始，但是这些挑战正是学习如何使用这些方法所需要的。诸如Hanon、Czerny、Cramer-Bulow、Dohnanyi Exercises，Cortot等练习/课程已经过时了。有一些钢琴演奏家是在这样的练习中培养出来的，他们仍然在教这种练习，这种练习当然也不是一文不值，但是有更好的方法。有很多容易表演的入门音乐，例如Magdalena的[Easy Bach](https://imslp.org/wiki/First_Lessons_in_Bach_%28Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian%29)。最重要的是，选择您喜欢的音乐。我们将选择贝多芬的《**Für Elise**》（[Sheet Music](http://www.pianopractice.org/sheetmusic2.pdf)）来说明练习方法，因为使用这些方法可以很快地学会它，并且包含说明它们所需的所有要素。

Listen to recordings of pieces you decide to learn. This is the fastest way to learn musicality and improve technique. It is a great way to gather musical ideas, and explore new material. Listen to several recordings of the same piece. Your teacher should be able to play and demonstrate for you; it is better to have teachers who can play your pieces.  
聆听您决定学习的作品的录音。 这是学习音乐和提高技巧的最快方法。 这是收集音乐思想和探索新材料的好方法。 聆听同一首作品的几张录音。 您的老师应该能够为您演奏和表演； 最好有可以演奏你的作品的老师。

Next, analyze the structure of the piece and estimate how long it will take to learn it — these are necessary components of \(59\) Project Management; advanced pianists become experts in project management. If you can not estimate the completion time, it means that you do not know all the practice methods needed to learn the piece. Of course, the estimate will be wrong, but the exercise of estimating teaches you what practice methods are needed. Without the estimate, there is a chance that you will never finish the piece; however, no music is ever finished, so how do you know you finished it? The performance! Once it is performed successfully, it is finished.

**Start analysis by numbering all the bars.** There are two versions of Für Elise sheet music differing in the way the repeats are indicated, which changes the bar numbers but does not change the music. I am using the long version with 124 full bars. The short version has \(105\) bars; the \( \) indicates the bars for the shorter version. The first 4 bars are repeated 15 times, so that by learning 4 bars, you can play 50% of the piece! Another 6 bars are repeated 4 times, so by learning 10 bars, you can play 70% of the piece. This 70% can be memorized in less than 30 minutes because these 10 bars are simple. There are two interruptions among these repetitions that are more difficult for a total of 50 distinct bars to learn. Each of the difficult sections can be memorized in one day, so you can memorize the entire piece in three days. Give yourself two more days to practice \(additional instructions are given below\), and you should be able to play the piece \(with questionable quality\) in a week. How long it will take you to polish this piece so that it is performable will depend on your skill level and knowledge of practice methods.
