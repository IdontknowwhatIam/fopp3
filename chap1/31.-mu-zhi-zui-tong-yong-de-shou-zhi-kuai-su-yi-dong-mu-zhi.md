# 31.拇指，最通用的手指，快速移动拇指

The thumb is the most versatile finger; it lets us play scales, arpeggios, and wide chords. It has four major ways to move down \(play a note\):  
拇指是最通用的手指；它使我们可以演奏音阶，琶音和宽音。它有四种主要的下移方式（弹一个音符）：

  
 \(1\) finger motion: with the hand motionless, play the thumb with only finger motion, by pivoting each finger at the knuckle \(the "thumb knuckle" is at the wrist\),  
（1）手指运动：用手不动，仅用手指运动即可用拇指弹奏， 在指关节上枢转每个手指（“指关节”在腕部）

  
 \(2\) wrist motion: with the forearm motionless and rigid fingers, play the thumb with wrist motion only,  
2）腕部运动：用前臂静止不动且僵硬的手指，仅腕部运动来用拇指弹

  
 \(3\) arm motion: with the fingers and wrist rigid, play the thumb by swinging the entire forearm down. This motion originates at the shoulder, and by  
（3）手臂运动：手指和手腕僵硬，将整个前臂向下摆动以用拇指弹。这个动作起源于肩膀，然后

\(4\) Forearm rotation \(\(21\) Forearm Rotation\).  
（4）前臂旋转（（21）前臂旋转）。

Practice each of these motions separately, eliminating all stress. First, practice each slowly, with large, exaggerated motion. Then increase speed by decreasing the motion. This exercise will reveal which is your fastest motion. Speed can be further increased by combining the motions because, when combined, smaller individual motions will be needed to accomplish the same key drop. Separating each motion is difficult at first, because we usually combine most of them for any thumb motion, which is why it is important to practice each motion separately.  
分别练习这些动作，消除所有压力。首先，以夸张的大动作慢慢练习。然后通过减少运动来提高速度。此练习将揭示您的最快动作。通过组合动作可以进一步提高速度，因为当组合在一起时，需要较小的单个动作来完成相同的按键放置。首先，很难分开每个动作，因为我们通常将大多数动作组合到任何拇指动作中，这就是为什么单独练习每个动作很重要的原因。

Play with the tip of the thumb, not the joint \(of the nail phalange\); this will enable the thumb to slide and the wrist to be raised, thus reducing the chances of the other fingers accidentally hitting unintended notes. Playing with the tip makes the thumb as long as possible, which is needed because it is the shortest finger. This also increases the range and speed of the thumb movement; that is, for the same thumb movement, the tip moves farther and faster than the joint.  
用拇指的指尖而不是指骨的关节弹。将使拇指滑动并抬起手腕，从而减少其他手指意外敲击意外音符的机会。弹尖会使拇指尽可能长，这是必需的，因为它是最短的手指。这也增加了拇指移动的范围和速度。也就是说，对于相同的拇指移动，尖端比关节运动得更快，更远。

There are two thumb positions: weak and power. Place both hands on the keys, straight in front, the thumb nails facing each other; this is the weak position. The thumbnails are almost vertical to the keyboard, and the tips of the thumbs are bent slightly towards the fingers so that they are almost parallel to the fingers. This position is useful for slow or easy passages.  
拇指有两个位置：虚弱和力量。将双手直接放在按键上，拇指指甲彼此相对；这是弱项。拇指甲几乎垂直于键盘，并且拇指的笔尖向手指稍微弯曲，因此它们几乎与手指平行。此位置对于缓慢或容易通过的段落很有用。

For technically difficult material, especially when power is needed, use the power thumb position: with both hands on the keyboard, extend the thumbs straight out, so that the thumbnails now face upwards towards your face \(LH thumb on G3, RH thumb on G4\). This position enables rapid play, makes optimum use of forearm rotation, allows complete relaxation, and utilizes the strongest muscles in the thumb: those powerful muscles that are used to push thumb tacks into a wall. Applying force in the weak position can cause pain and injury, not only to thumb muscles, but also elsewhere.  
对于技术上较困难的材料，尤其是在需要力量的情况下，请使用力量拇指位置：用双手在键盘上，将拇指笔直伸出，使拇指甲现在朝上朝向您的脸（G3上的LH拇指，G4上的RH拇指）。这个姿势可以快速运动，充分利用前臂旋转，完全放松，并利用拇指最强壮的肌肉：那些用来将图钉推入墙壁的强壮肌肉。在弱处施加力不仅会导致拇指肌肉受伤，还会导致其他部位的疼痛和受伤。

The power thumb position is attained by raising the wrist so that you play closer to the palm-side tip of the thumb. This automatically causes the thumb to point down and engages the strong muscles of the thumb. The weak thumb position is attained by lowering the wrist so that the hand is level with the forearm: you are now playing more with the side of the thumb. In general, try the weak thumb position first, and if this is inadequate, gradually add the strong position. Thus the use of weak/strong thumb is analogous to TU/TO; they are not generally used in their extreme positions, but somewhere in between. Most of us think of the thumb as the strongest finger; however, even the pinky can overpower the thumb in its weak position, especially at high speeds. The strengths of the thumb and pinky can be balanced by a proper choice of the weak/power thumb positions, in applications such as the octave tremolo.  
抬起手腕可达到拇指的力量位置，从而使您的演奏更靠近拇指的手掌侧尖端。这会自动使拇指指向下方并接合拇指的强壮肌肉。放下手腕，使手与前臂齐平，即可达到拇指虚弱位置：您现在可以用拇指的另一侧弹了。通常，请先尝试弱拇指位置，如果这不足，请逐渐增加强手指位置。因此，弱拇指/强拇指的使用类似于TU / TO。它们通常不在其极端位置使用，而是介于两者之间。我们大多数人将拇指视为最强壮的手指；但是，即使是小指也可以使拇指处于弱状态，特别是在高速时，也能胜过拇指。在八度颤音之类的应用中，可以通过适当选择弱/强力拇指位置来平衡拇指和小指的力量。
